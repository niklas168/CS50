##### general Idea
I undertook the task of creating a comprehensive database based on a CSV file containing football (soccer) player statistics. The focal point of this project is a Scouting Assistant program designed to identify the best players based on user-defined requirements.

The first step was to develop the create_table.py script, which is responsible for transforming the data in the 21_22_Players.csv file into a structured table. This CSV file encompasses an extensive range of player statistics from the top five football leagues in Europe. The script extracts the header row from the CSV file and concatenates the column names into a single string to form an SQL statement. The majority of the data types are numeric, with a few exceptions at the beginning being text-based. The SQL statement is then executed to create the table with the appropriate columns.

With the table in place, the next task was to populate it with data using the data_insert.py script. I utilized a for loop to iterate over the rows of the CSV file and inserted the values into the table using placeholders. To ensure the correct number of placeholders, I calculated the number of columns in the table beforehand. Each row of values replaces the placeholders, and this process is repeated for each row in the CSV file. Consequently, we now have a fully populated database with a single table that can be queried using the sqlite3 module.

Moving on to the main program, Scouting_Assistant.py, in football, there are three primary positions: defender, midfielder, and attacker. However, the roles and responsibilities within these positions can vary significantly. Since the table we created does not include a filter for specific player roles, I implemented a mechanism to address this limitation. The Scouting Assistant prompts the user to indicate whether they require an immediate first-team player or a young prospect for the future. Subsequently, a series of questions are posed to narrow down the specific type of player needed. I extensively studied the data and established benchmark statistics for various player types. Based on the user's preferences and the corresponding benchmark stats, an SQL statement is dynamically generated. This SQL statement is then executed, and the resulting player recommendations are displayed to the user.

In the future, I envision enhancing the user experience by creating an HTML website to make the Scouting Assistant more user-friendly. This would allow me to leverage my knowledge of both frontend and backend web development. Additionally, I would actively seek out more football data to expand the database and potentially create multiple tables with improved handling capabilities, as the current single table may become unwieldy as the dataset grows.
